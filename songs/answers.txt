If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

The average enery for the person is - 0.659

The average valence for the person is - 0.484

The average danceability for the person is - 0.716

CONCLUSION

From this data we can conclude the aura of the person is Purple.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

The problem as to why this my not be an accurate represantation of the person as a whole would be because music choice would be affected by life situation that happened in the previous year and might not reflect the actual aura of the person as a whole.
